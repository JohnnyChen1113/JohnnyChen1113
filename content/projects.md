**Meta:** Doctoral Research · PI: Dr. [Zhenguo Lin](https://zlinlab.org/people.html) · NSF Funded
**Tags:** CAGE-seq, Comparative Genomics, Fungi

- Investigating the mechanisms and evolution of transcription start site (TSS) selection across fungal species. 
- Performed large-scale comparative genomic analysis of TSS evolution across 70+ fungal species using CAGE-seq and comparative genomics approaches. 
- Led the construction of TSSHub, a genomic database for transcription initiation studies across eukaryotes.

## Western Painted Turtle Genome and Isoform Resource

**Meta:** Collaborative Project · with Dr. [Daniel Warren](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/biology/faculty/warren-daniel.php) · NSF Funded
**Tags:** Genome Assembly, PacBio Iso-Seq, Transcriptomics

Assembled a high-quality, chromosome-level reference genome for the western painted turtle (*Chrysemys picta bellii*) and performed PacBio Iso-Seq–based transcriptome analysis across multiple tissues and developmental stages. Generated a comprehensive isoform-level annotation resource for studying the genetic basis of hypoxia/anoxia tolerance and for broader functional and comparative genomics.

### Outcomes

First author manuscript under review.
