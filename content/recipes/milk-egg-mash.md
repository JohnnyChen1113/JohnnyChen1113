## Ingredients

- Milk: 500mL
- Eggs: 2
- Fermented Rice Wine (Laozao): 2 tbsp
- Goji berries & Raisins: To taste
- Nuts (Sesame, Almond, Peanut, Walnut): Crushed, to taste
- (Optional) Edible Alkali: A pinch (if Laozao is sour)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Boil Milk

Pour milk into a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir constantly in a clockwise direction to prevent uneven heating and burning.

### Step 2: Add Fermented Rice Wine

Add 2 tablespoons of fermented rice wine (Laozao). Reduce heat to low and continue stirring until it boils again. This helps evaporate some alcohol content.

> **Tip:** If the Laozao is sour, add a pinch of edible alkali to prevent the milk protein from curdling.

### Step 3: Add Dried Fruits

Sprinkle goji berries and raisins into the pot. Simmer briefly until they absorb some moisture and plump up.

### Step 4: Add Eggs

Turn up the heat. Pour in the beaten eggs while stirring gently. High heat helps form nice egg flowers. Once the egg flowers float to the surface, turn off the heat.

### Step 5: Serve

Ladle into a bowl and top with crushed nuts (walnuts, almonds, peanuts, sesame seeds). Enjoy!
